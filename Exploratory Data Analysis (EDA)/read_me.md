### Project Overview: Bank Churn & Growth Analysis - Predicting Churn & Customer Segmentation

The Product Team at the Bank has observed an uptick in customer churn and a decline in overall growth. To address these issues and enhance customer retention, the team is looking to reduce churn and appeal to new customers. 
This project aims to explore and prepare customer data to provide actionable insights and to create predictive models that can help the team make data-driven decisions.

In this repository, we will go through the initial stages of data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which will serve as the foundation for two major machine learning projects: prediction and customer segmentation.

*Churn Prediction: Predicting which customers are likely to churn.* 

*Customer Segmentation: Identifying distinct customer segments to help personalize marketing and retention efforts.*

### Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer churn in a banking environment, focusing on data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
This involves understanding the key drivers of churn, identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior, and uncovering insights that can assist the bank in retaining its customers.

#### 1. Join & QA the Data:
-  Combine multiple data sources to create a unified dataset for analysis.
-  Perform data quality checks to ensure completeness and accuracy (e.g., detect missing values, outliers, inconsistencies).

#### 2. Clean the Data:
-  Handle missing data through imputation or removal.
-  Clean categorical variables, ensure consistent data entry, and handle any potential errors in labels.
-  Check data types and remove duplicates.

#### 3. Explore Feature Relationships with Customer Churn:
-  Investigate correlations between features and churn, identifying trends and patterns.
-  Use visual tools to explore the relationship between key features (e.g., balance, age, tenure) and churn status.
-  Build a box plots for each numeric field, broken out by churners vs non-churners.
-  Build a bar plots for each categorical field, broken out by churners vs non-churners.
-  Build a histograms for each numeric field, broken out by churners vs non-churners.
-  Identify the key drivers of churn using feature importance metrics or by inspecting feature relationships visually.

#### 4. Prepare the Data for Modeling:
-  Apply feature engineering to create relevant variables for predictive models.
-  Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

### Key Insights Expected:
* Churn Drivers: Identification of features that most significantly contribute to customer churn, enabling targeted retention strategies.
* Customer Segmentation: Understanding of customer groups that can be targeted with tailored marketing and retention programs.
* Actionable Insights: Concrete recommendations for reducing churn and improving overall customer experience and growth.

### Conclusion:
*The projectâ€™s data preparation and exploratory data analysis will provide a comprehensive understanding of customer churn and its influencing factors. 
By using these insights, the bank can better target retention efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and develop more effective strategies to reduce churn. 
Further steps would include predictive modeling and deployment of machine learning algorithms to predict churn and provide actionable business solutions.*

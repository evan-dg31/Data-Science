## Simple Regression with statsmodels and scikit-learn
This repository demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression using two popular Python libraries: statsmodels and scikit-learn. Both libraries offer different approaches to fitting regression models, and this project showcases how to use each of them.

### Libraries Used
* statsmodels: Provides more detailed statistical analysis and diagnostics for linear regression models.
* scikit-learn: A machine learning library that offers a straightforward approach for fitting regression models, with an emphasis on machine learning workflows.


### Usage

* Regression with statsmodels - statsmodels allows for easy statistical analysis and includes detailed information such as R-squared, p-values, and confidence intervals.
* Regression with scikit-learn - scikit-learn is great for machine learning tasks and provides an easy-to-use interface for fitting regression models.

### Results Comparison
Both methods will output similar regression results, but statsmodels provides more statistical details, whereas scikit-learn is more commonly used in production environments for making predictions.

### Requirements
* statsmodels
* scikit-learn
* numpy

### Conclusion
This project provides a comparison of linear regression techniques using two common Python libraries. 
Depending on your needs (statistical analysis vs machine learning workflow), you can choose the appropriate tool for your regression tasks.
